                A <strong>best itinerary for Jaipur-Udaipur</strong> stretches over 5-6 days. Start in {Link('Jaipur', 'https://www.rajasthantourpackages.in/jaipur')} and spend <strong>2- 3 days</strong> highlights like the Amber Fort, City Palace, Hawa Mahal and Jantar Mantar. Do not miss a visit to Chokhi Dhani, where you can like an artistic feel and traditional Rajasthani food. Then, drive to Udaipur, which will take only 2-3 days to visit the city palace, Jag Mandir and a leisure boat ride in Lake Pichola. Saheliyon ki Bari and the Monsoon Palace are good places to visit and for a view. At this slow tempo you can appreciate the history, arts and scenic views of both cities to the fullest.

                The <strong>best time to visit Jaipur and Udaipur</strong> is between <strong>October and March</strong>.

                <strong>Jaipur and Udaipur</strong> are located in Rajasthan, which is famous for its deserts, neither megacity offers the typical desert landscapes like beach stacks that you would find in places like Jaisalmer or {Link('Bikaner', 'https://www.rajasthantourpackages.in/bikaner')}. However, you can feel the desert in Pushkar, which is situated between Jaipur and Udaipur. Camel rides are available in Pushkar and around the <strong>Pushkar Lake</strong> as well as in the desert area around Pushkar. The normal camel safari lets you move through small villages, the dunes, and the rest of the desert area to give you a feel of rural Rajasthan.
