                A <strong>3-days Rajasthan trip</strong> is sufficient to have a taste of the natural beauty of the place, though not enough for a deeper tour of the region. You may talk about the best places to visit in one or two cities like Jaipur, Udaipur, and Jodhpur, and give a brief overview of the city, its history, art, and architecture. But I suppose Rajasthan is a very big state, and there are a lot of places to visit like forests, palaces, and temples. If more time were available, one would want to get to experience several other terrains and different cultures. If one is planning to visit a 3-day Rajasthan trip it will just give one a taste of what is on offer, though for a substantive tour one needs more than three days in the region.

                Yes, You can cover Thar Desert and Jaisalmer in 3 days, but then it will be a weekend tour. On Day 1, it is possible to get to Jaisalmer and visit the Jaisalmer Fort, the first house of merchants Patwon Ki Haveli and the markets. On day 2, you can first go to the India-Pak Border, Tanot Mata Temple, and Longewala War Museum and, by evening, reach the Thar Desert, enjoying a dune-bashing Jeep safari, a camel ride over dunes and staying at a desert camp. On Day 3 you can visit our Jaisalmer tour covering Kuldhara The Cursed Village, Wood Fossil Park, Amar Sagar, Bada Bagh, and then return to Jaisalmer Airport or Railway Station to connect your onward journey.

                Yes, there can be 3-day Rajasthan guided tours but they generally take tourists around the main highlights of the state. One of the favourite routes will still be Jaipur, the pink city, where guests will be able to visit sites and culture such as {Link('Amer Fort', 'https://www.rajasthantourpackages.in/jaipur')}, Hawa Mahal and the city palace. The second day can include visiting the attractions of Udaipur, which is famous for its breathtaking lakes and palaces: City Palace and Jag Mandir. The last day, you can visit Jodhpur, the Mehrangarh Fort, and the blue city. These tours are convenient for travellers who want not only to see but also to feel the spirit of the state and its history and to learn more about unique architectural works, all with the help of a professional guide and in the minimum time.
