                For a <strong>short trip</strong> to Rajasthan, pack light, breathable clothing for the heat of the day and layers for cool evenings, especially in winter. Take comfortable walking shoes for exploring, a hat, sunglasses, sun cream, and a reusable water bottle to keep you hydrated. A power bank will keep your devices charged. Modest dress is recommended, especially by women, particularly when on a tour of religious centers. Both men and women have to be fast and tie their heads with a scarf or shawl before they can enter a temple or any other place of worship. Always respect local customs and dress codes to ensure a respectful and smooth journey.
