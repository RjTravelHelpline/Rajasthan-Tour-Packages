                Visiting Jaipur and Udaipur in just <strong>2 days</strong> is not easy because these cities are about 400 miles apart, and there are lots of things to do in each. That is why if you plan to visit both cities, you should create a good schedule with little sightseeing in each city.  In Jaipur sightseeing, you can see highlights like Amber Fort, Hawa Mahal, and City Palace. In Udaipur Sightseeing, you can find Lake Pichola, City Palace, and Jag Mandir. However, the distance between the two cities is approximately 6-7 hours, and of course, all your visiting time will be spent traveling. Taking some time to focus on a town will be quite a wonderful experience.
