This is also when Rajasthan hosts many cultural festivals like the Jaipur Literature Festival and the {Link('Pushkar Camel Fair', 'https://www.rajasthantourpackages.in/blog/pushkar-camel-fair-cultural-tourism-rajasthan')}. Summers can be very hot, so they are not ideal for travel, except for hill stations like Mount Abu.
