        answer: (

                The best time to visit Rajasthan is from October to March, during the winter season. The weather is
                pleasant and perfect for sightseeing and outdoor activities. This is also when Rajasthan hosts many
                cultural festivals like the Jaipur Literature Festival and the Pushkar Camel Fair. Summers can be very
                hot, so they are not ideal for travel, except for hill stations like Mount Abu.
