Facelifted roads, new <strong>luxury hotels</strong>, and <strong>smart city development</strong> in Jaipur are turning this city into an <strong>international city</strong>. Tourists do not have to forego modern facilities in order to experience Rajasthani warmth or have to stay in typical Rajasthani homes but can have the two rolled into one.</p>
        <p>Jaipur is gradually developing into a world city in that several world events are being held, such as the annual Writers and Artists <strong>Jaipur Literature Festival</strong> for writers, artists, and professors. This city has taken firm root in embracing its cultural part of India, which includes arts, architecture, and food.</p>
        <h3>The Future of Jaipur: A City That is Both Traditional and Modern</h3>
        <p>In later years, Jaipur prepared itself for a much more promising future. As a part of the sustainable development of infrastructure, the approach to tourism development is seen in Jaipur vision to become one of the prime tourist spots in the world. Because of the conservation of its antecedent and the novelties it experiences, tourists from the international scene will still flock to the Pink City in the coming years.</p>
