        <p className='mb-0'>For those who wish to have another side of wildlife, which is adventurous in a real sense, then Desert National Park of Jaisalmer is the place. This park is in the center of the Thar desert and is a good chance to get acquainted with the desert in Rajasthan. The park is inhabited by Great Indian Bustards, foxes, camels, desert foxes, and other creatures of the desert, that is why it attracts those tourists who are in search of a quite unusual experience of fauna-watching.
          The area is desolate and arid, thus providing a dramatic difference to the green midland forests covering other wildlife districts in the state. Hiking, making camp in high sands, and observing the large open skies are a few of the attractions in this trail.</p>
        <p className="fw-bold mt-2 mb-0">Things to do:</p>
        <p className='mb-0'>• scarred by careless sand ruts and crowned with humped animals, designed for traveling the desert and searching for wild animals.</p>
        <p className='mb-0'>• Expedition by crossing through the desert in order to taste the difficulty of it.</p>
        <p className='mb-0'>• The desert is a prime location to camp to have an incredible and unusual adventure.</p>

Tourists do not have to forego modern facilities in order to experience Rajasthani warmth or have to stay in typical Rajasthani homes but can have the two rolled into one.</p>
